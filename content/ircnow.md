### IRC Bouncers

With an IRC bouncer, you will now be able to receive messages while you're offline. A bouncer helps save messages for you while you're disconnected so your IRC client can download them once you log in later on. Our bouncer also lets you chat with users on any IRC network and even other chat protocols such as Telegram or Discord. It also cloaks your IP from others for anonymity and security.

### IRC Bots

Request a free bot to use for your channel. We provide channel relays to connect multiple IRC networks and bridges to connect IRC with other protocols. We also provide chat bots and Bible bots.

### VPN

Get a free VPN account. This can be useful for security reasons (such as when you connect to a wifi hotspot), for anonymity reasons (since it hides your IP), and access to news sites and more.

### Email

Get a free email account! We give all users a combined total of 1GB of storage with each file storage account. We support all open protocols: POP, IMAP, and SMTP, and you can export your account whenever you want. We do not sell user data to third parties.

### File Storage

Get free file storage! We give all users a combined total of 1GB of storage with each file storage and email account. We currently support sftp/scp and plan to add support for rsync.

### Code Hosting

Get free code hosting! We provide hosting for git and cvs.

### OpenBSD Guides

You can learn OpenBSD by reading our [how to guides](https://wiki.ircnow.org/index.php?n=Minutemin.Bootcamp) and join our community at [#openbsd](ircs://irc.ircnow.org/#openbsd). We aim to provide working examples and topics not covered by the excellent OpenBSD man pages.
